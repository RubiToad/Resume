    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I'm Tyler Mondalto, a computer science student and indie game developer. I have dreams of becoming a full-stack developer and releasing many great games on steam!
    To further my goals, I'm making this website for practice!

    <h2>Active Projects</h2>
    <h3>Dine in Dungeon</h3>
    <p>This is a fantasy, cooking game where you cook using the strange produce and monsters found in a fantasy dungeon. I've been working on it over the summer
    with two friends, and we're aiming for a 2025 release!</p>
    <h3>2024 Web Development Bootcamp</h3>
    <p>I'm currently enrolled in Dr. Angela Yu's Web Development Bootcamp. In this course I'm learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a number of other
    front-end development skills! This is another summer project of mine to help me on my way to becoming a full-stack developer.</p>
    <h3>Complete Java Developmental Bootcamp</h3>
    <p>Over summer I also plan to learn the fundamentals of Java. I'm taking this bootcamp to round out my programming skills. After completing this, I'll have backend programming knowledge in C, C++, Python, and Java!</p>
